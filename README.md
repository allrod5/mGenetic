# Modular Algorithms
Modular Algorithms for non-deterministic search.

Modular Genetic Algorithm, mGenetic and Modular Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, mPSO, are implemented here.

This is a project made for the Artificial Intelligence undergraduate course of UFABC.
Here we compare genetic algorithms using Python 3.
